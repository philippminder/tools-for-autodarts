# :dart: Tools for Autodarts v2.1.18 Released! :dart:

### :new: New Features
- **Checkout Only Zoom Option**: Added new toggle for Darts Zoom feature to show zoom images only when checkout is available
- **WLED Integration (BETA)**: :warning: NEW synchronized lighting effects during gameplay - trigger HTTP requests based on game events, CSV import support, drag & drop reordering, and smart effect selection with priority system *(Feature currently in BETA - I'm unable to test this since I don't have a WLED setup)*

### :sparkles: Enhanced Features
- **Caller Checkout Guide**: Enhanced functionality to support specific combined sounds with intelligent fallback system
  - Prioritizes short form "yr_XXX" sounds (e.g., "yr_120")
  - Falls back to specific "you_require_XXX" sounds
  - Finally uses separate "you_require" + score sounds if needed

### :wastebasket: Removed Features
- **Ring Feature**: Removed as it has been officially implemented by the Autodarts Team

### :pray: Special Thanks
- **@meister_bob_** for contributing the WLED Integration feature!
