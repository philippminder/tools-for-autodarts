### üó£Ô∏è Caller Feature
The Caller feature provides voice announcements during your darts gameplay, similar to professional darts tournaments:

#### Configuration Options
- **Call Every Dart**: Announces each dart as it's thrown, rather than waiting for the end of a turn
- **Call Checkout**: Announces possible checkout combinations when a player is on a checkout score
- **Custom Sound Library**: Add, edit, and organize voice clips for different game events

#### Supported Triggers
You can assign sounds to be played based on these triggers:

- **Points**: `0` to `180` (point totals)
- **Point Ranges**: A range between `0` and `180`, e.g. `0-20` or `100-180` (point totals)
- **Singles**: `s1` to `s20` and `s25` (single segments)
- **Doubles**: `d1` to `d20` and `bull` (double segments and bullseye)
- **Triples**: `t1` to `t20` (triple segments)
- **Special Voice Lines**:
  - `gameon`: At the start of a new game
  - `gameshot`: When a player wins the game
  - `you_require`: Plays before announcing checkout combinations (numbers are called separately)
  - `busted`: When a player busts
  - `double`, `triple`: Generic announcements for dart types
  - `outside`: When a dart lands outside the scoring area
  - `next_player`: Plays when switching to the next player (fallback if no player name sound is found)
  - `bot`: Plays instead of player name when the player is a CPU/bot player
  - `playername`: Player name sounds play automatically when it's their turn. Example: If your name is `creazy.eth` on Autodarts, simply use `creazy.eth` (supports spaces or `_` like `player_name` or `player name`)
- **Cricket-Specific**:
  - `cricket_hit`: When a player hits a Cricket target (15-20 and Bull)
  - `cricket_miss`: When a player hits a non-Cricket target (Miss-14)

#### Cricket Mode Behavior
In Cricket games, the caller has specific behavior:
- `cricket_hit` is triggered when a player hits a target that's still open (15-20 and Bull)
- `cricket_miss` is triggered when a player hits any other number (Miss-14) or hits a target that's already closed by all players
- Regular throw sounds (like `t20`, `d16`) are still announced when enabled

#### Audio Interaction Requirements
Due to browser security policies, especially on Safari and mobile browsers, audio can only be played after user interaction (click, tap, or keypress). The extension will:
- Automatically detect when audio can't be played
- Show a notification prompting the user to interact with the page
- Automatically unlock audio playback once interaction occurs
- Queue up sounds to ensure nothing is missed during this process

#### Predefined Caller Sets
The extension comes with ready-to-use caller sets that you can easily import:

##### Dutch (nl-NL)
- **NL - Laura (Female)**: Dutch female voice caller

##### French (fr-FR) 
- **FR - Remi (Male)**: French male voice caller
- **FR - Lea (Female)**: French female voice caller

##### Spanish (es-ES)
- **ES - Lucia (Female)**: Spanish female voice caller

Simply select one of these presets when adding sounds through the "Import from URL" option in the Caller settings.

> [!NOTE]
> Some predefined caller sets may not work in Safari due to browser restrictions. Tools for Autodarts is not responsible for the content of these caller sets.

#### Intelligent Fallback System
The caller has a sophisticated fallback system to provide complete coverage even with limited sound files:
- **Segment Announcements**: If a specific segment sound (e.g., `s20`) isn't available, it automatically plays just the number (`20`)
- **Double/Triple Handling**: For doubles and triples, it follows the pattern of playing the word followed by the number (e.g., `d20` ‚Üí `double` + `20`)
- **Miss Handling**: `miss` or `m` prefixed throws will fall back to `outside` sounds
- **Matchshot Handling**: When no `matchshot` sound is available, the system will automatically use the `gameshot` sound instead
- **Player Announcements**: Automatically announces the current player's name at the start of their turn
- **Game Start**: Plays the "game on" sound at the beginning of a match

#### Cross-Browser Audio Support
- Compatible with all major browsers including Safari on iOS/MacOS
- Automatic audio unlocking for mobile browsers that require user interaction
- Queued sound playback to ensure all announcements are heard in the correct order

### üîä Sound FX Feature
The Sound FX feature adds ambient sound effects to your gameplay experience:

#### Game Event Sounds
Add sound effects for various game events:
- **Point Triggers**: Sounds can be triggered for any score from `ambient_0` to `ambient_180`
- **Individual Throws**: Sounds for specific throws like `ambient_s20`, `ambient_d16`, `ambient_t19`, etc.
- **Combined Throws**: Trigger sounds based on a sequence of throws using format `s20_t19_d12`
- **Special Events**: Dedicated sounds for `ambient_gameon`, `gameshot`, `busted`, and more
- **Player Turn Sounds**: 
  - `ambient_next_player`: Plays when switching to the next player (fallback if no player name sound exists)
  - `ambient_bot`: Plays when switching to a CPU/bot player
  - `bot_throw`: Plays when a bot player throws a dart
  - Player-specific sounds using format: `ambient_playername` or `ambient_player_name`
- **Lobby Sounds**:
  - `ambient_lobby_in`: Plays when a player joins the lobby
  - `ambient_lobby_out`: Plays when a player leaves the lobby
- **Player-Specific Gameshot**: Create personalized winning sounds for specific players using the following formats:
  - `gameshot_player name` (spaces preserved)
  - `gameshot_player_name` (with underscores replacing spaces)
  - With ambient prefix: `ambient_gameshot_player_name`
- **Cricket Mode**: Special triggers for Cricket games:
  - `cricket_hit`: Triggered when hitting Cricket targets (15-20 and Bull) that are still open
  - `cricket_miss`: Triggered when hitting non-Cricket targets (Miss-14) or hitting targets already closed by all players

#### Match vs Game Winning Sounds
The Sound FX feature distinguishes between winning a single game (gameshot) and winning the entire match (matchshot):
- **Match Win**: `ambient_matchshot` or `matchshot` triggers when a player wins the complete match
- **Game Win**: `ambient_gameshot` or `gameshot` triggers when a player wins a single game/leg
- **Player-Specific Match Win**: Create personalized match winning sounds:
  - `matchshot_player_name` (with underscores)
  - `matchshot_player name` (with spaces)
  - With ambient prefix: `ambient_matchshot_player_name`

#### Ambient Sound Prefix
- Use the `ambient_` prefix (e.g., `ambient_180`, `ambient_t20`) to create separate sound sets for caller and ambient sounds
- This allows you to have professional voice announcements via the Caller while also having fun sound effects via Sound FX

#### Dual Audio Channels
- Enhanced sound playback with separate audio channels for caller and ambient sounds
- Improved game mode handling for specialized sound triggers
- Better performance with simultaneous sound playback

#### Smart Fallback System
The Sound FX feature includes a sophisticated multi-level fallback system:
- If an exact match with `ambient_` prefix isn't found, it tries without the prefix
- For segment triggers like `ambient_t20`, it tries multiple fallbacks in this order:
  - Exact match: `ambient_t20`
  - Without ambient prefix: `t20`
  - Split into word+number: `ambient_triple` + `ambient_20`
  - Non-ambient word+number: `triple` + `20`
  - Just the number: `20`
- Similar fallback chains exist for double segments (`d16`) and single segments (`s1`)
- For `miss` or `m` prefixed throws, it falls back to `outside` sounds
- In Cricket games, `miss` triggers may fall back to `cricket_miss` sounds
- **Matchshot Fallbacks**: When a player wins a match, the system tries sounds in this order:
  - Player-specific matchshot: `ambient_matchshot_player_name`
  - Player-specific gameshot: `ambient_gameshot_player_name`
  - Generic matchshot: `ambient_matchshot`
  - Generic gameshot: `ambient_gameshot`
- If no match is found after all fallback attempts, no sound is played

#### Technical Features
- **Queue Management**: Enhanced sound queue management to prevent overlapping and ensure proper playback order (improved in v2.0.3)
- **Format Support**: Plays both URL-based sounds and base64-encoded audio
- **IndexedDB Storage**: Efficiently stores sound files in browser database to improve performance
- **Error Handling**: Automatically falls back to alternative sources if a sound fails to play
- **Safari Compatible**: Works with all major browsers including Safari's strict audio policies

### üé¨ Animations

The Animations feature allows you to display custom GIF animations for special events during gameplay:

#### Configuration
- **Delay**: Set how long to wait before showing the animation (in seconds)
- **Duration**: Set how long the animation should display (in seconds)
- **Object Fit**: Choose between 'cover' (fill screen) or 'contain' (maintain aspect ratio)

#### Supported Triggers
Animations can be triggered by various game events using these tags:

- **Points**: `0` to `180` (total points scored in a turn)
- **Singles**: `s0` to `s20` and `25` (single segments, `25` for bull)
- **Doubles**: `d1` to `d20` (double segments, `bull` for bullseye)
- **Triples**: `t1` to `t20` (triple segments)
- **Special Events**:
  - `bull`: When a player hits the bullseye
  - `outside`: When a dart lands outside the scoring area
  - `busted`: When a player busts (scores more than needed)
  - `gameshot`: When a player wins the game or leg

#### Combination Tags
You can also use combination tags to trigger animations based on specific dart throw combinations. Format: `[first dart]_[second dart]_[third dart]`

Example: `s20_s5_d20` would trigger when a player throws single 20, then single 5, then double 20.

You can add multiple triggers for the same animation by entering each trigger on a new line in the animation settings.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you assign the same trigger to multiple animations, the system will randomly select one of the matching animations to play each time the trigger occurs. This allows for variety in your gameplay experience.
